### Misc plots

Some large scale simulations were run on the server, and as such, the code and plots can't be found in the repo (although, the code is just modified versions of what's here).

This folder contains some plots pulled from the server that were sitting on my PC. I'm just dumping them here to clean stuff up.

It mainly is to find the power law point and look at other stats (population counts, boundaries, productions, etc) vs $\theta$.
