# Self Organized Soil

[The paper](https://doi.org/10.1103/v8hj-k8t8) is finally out! Please take a look!


This repository contains all the code used in the simulations and analysis in my masters thesis.

The thesis is written under [Kim Sneppen](https://nbi.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/41236) and [Kunihiko Kaneko](https://nbi.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/440257) at the [Niels Bohr Institute](https://nbi.ku.dk/english/), from August 2023 to June 2024. It was continued and refined in the first year of my PhD.

## The Topic

The project initially aimed at explaining the fractal nature of soil, by generating a simple model that self-organizes into the desired structure.

It evolved into a study of a mutual feedback loop between organisms and physical structure: we make a simple model where organisms shape soil, and the spatial structure of the soil helps the organisms thrive.

## Directory Structure

The top-level directory contains two folders of interest:

* `src`, which contains all the source code used for the simulations
* `docs`, which contains code for the visualizations (and perhaps documentation?) on the [webpage](https://rizfn.github.io/Self-Organized-Soil/)
