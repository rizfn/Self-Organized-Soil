# Self Organized Soil

**A Preprint is out on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20662)!** 

This repository contains all the code used in the simulations and analysis in my masters thesis.

The thesis is written under [Kim Sneppen](https://nbi.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/41236) and [Kunihiko Kaneko](https://nbi.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/440257) at the [Niels Bohr Institute](https://nbi.ku.dk/english/), from August 2023 to June 2024.

## The Topic

The project aims at explaining the fractal nature of soil, by generating a simple model that self-organizes into the desired structure.


## Directory Structure

The top-level directory contains two folders of interest:

* `src`, which contains all the source code used for the simulations
* `docs`, which contains code for the visualizations (and perhaps documentation?) on the [webpage](https://rizfn.github.io/Self-Organized-Soil/)
